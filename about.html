<h2 class="about">Web Developer, Rubyist, Disc Golfer</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    I enjoy developing software that allows me to find elegant solutions to complex problems. Recently converted Rubyist, I have a history developing in many languages, libraries, and frameworks, in medium to high traffic web properties for both the server and client side.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the last few years I have lead development teams in the social networking and Software as a Service (SaaS) spaces to successful product launches including <a href="http://www.faithvillage.com/">FaithVillage</a> and <a href="http://mycommunify.com/">Communify</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am also the author of the first published book on the Kohana 3 PHP Framework, "Beginning Kohana 3 Development", released in 2011 by Packt Publishing.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I am not sitting in front of my computer creating awesomeness, I can usually be found playing disc golf with my 7 year old son, building legos (sometimes with my 7 year old son), or goofing off with electronics, like the arduino.
